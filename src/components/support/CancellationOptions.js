                            you covered.<br />

                                typically set by property hosts and can vary. It's important to  <br />
                                review the cancellation<br />
                                policy of a specific property before booking to understand your <br />
                                options in case you need to cancel your reservation.<br />

                                Key Considerations:<br />
                                Policy Variety: Our diverse range of cancellation policies recognizes<br />
                                the unique circumstances <br />
                                of different hosts. This allows you to choose a property with a cancellation <br />
                                policy that aligns with your comfort level. <br />

                            
                                Host Autonomy: Property hosts have the autonomy to set cancellation policies <br />
                                that best suit their <br />

                                are aware of the terms before confirming a reservation. <br />

                                 
                                Informed Decisions: Understanding the cancellation policy of a specific  <br />
                                property empowers you to <br />
                                make informed decisions. We encourage guests to review these policies  <br />
                                thoroughly to ensure alignment with their travel plans. <br />
